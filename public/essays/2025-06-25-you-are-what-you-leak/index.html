<p>I recently read <em>Story of the Eye</em> by Georges Bataille. It was 1 AM, which is only second to 3 AM in terms of the worst time to make decisions. And oh boy was this a decision.</p>
<p>This is a first draft, posted because praxis innit.</p>
<p>I initially disregarded <em>Story of the Eye</em> as surrealist pornography and went to sleep. It has been days and it is haunting my dreams. I simply cannot stop thinking about it. This has been making eating eggs uncomfortable.</p>

  Context
  <a class="anchor" href="#context">#</a>
</h2>
<p><em>Story of the Eye</em>, or <em>L’histoire de l’oeil</em> as it was originally called, was written by Georges Bataille and published in 1928 under the pseudonym Lord Auch. I assume he did this for the bit, considering ‘Auch’ is short for ‘aux chiottes’.</p>
<p>It is often viewed as real kinky shit, but it can also be viewed as a philosophical text. Some academics use Bataille’s later works to support this perspective. If you are interested in the analyses of actual academics, please check out [[#Further Reading]].</p>
<p>You may notice I said “actual academics”. That is because I never got further than National 5 English. I have absolutely zero relevant credentials. Fortunately, I do have an inflated sense of self-importance.</p>
<p>Welcome to my century-later analysis of <em>Story of the Eye</em>. Spoilers ahead.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="summary">
  Summary
  <a class="anchor" href="#summary">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bataille starts off unhinged with two distantly related teenagers performing unusual sexual activities with each other. This begins with Simone, the object of The Narrator’s desires, lowering herself onto a dish of milk.</p>
<p>The Narrator and Simone’s activities soon escalate as they bring other teenagers into their dubiously consensual fantasies. This includes Marcelle, a girl who becomes the subject of the teens’ desire to corrupt.</p>
<p>When Marcelle is sectioned after an orgy, The Narrator and Simone break her out of the institution. After returning to the scene of her psychic break, she hangs herself.</p>
<p>After Marcelle’s suicide, Simone and The Narrator flee to Spain where they seek out the company of Sir Edmund, a debauched, older man. Together, they engage in deranged sexual acts culminating in the seduction, desecration, and murder of a young priest.</p>

<p>After reading the summary, it would be easy (and forgivable) to dismiss <em>Story of the Eye</em> as nothing more than an unhinged serious of shock moments strung together for maximum discomfort. Perhaps that is all it was to Bataille. But the more I think about the events of the novella, the more I find evidence for something deeper–or at least more meaningful.</p>
<p>If we strip away the titillating veneer of pornography, what remains is a narrative obsessed with waste, ritual, and transgression. Beneath that, there are murkier undercurrents: Catholic guilt, performed womanhood, and fluids as autonomy.</p>
<p>This essay reads <em>Story of the Eye</em> as a theological inversion, using queer, neurodivergent, and bodily-focused lenses to interrogate how sacredness emerges through defilement.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="virgin-mother-martyr-womanhood-as-refusal">
  Virgin, Mother, Martyr: Womanhood as Refusal
  <a class="anchor" href="#virgin-mother-martyr-womanhood-as-refusal">#</a>
</h3>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss Simone as a fetish object without agency—many have, and not without reason. But I couldn’t help being fascinated by her. Simone is not a passive figure in <em>Story of the Eye</em>. If anything, she’s the driving force behind the novella’s spiral into transgression. Perhaps that was Bataille’s kink. But if I’m going to treat this as a serious text, Simone deserves to be treated as a serious character.</p>
<p>Simone is aroused by impurity—not just metaphorically, but viscerally. She is drawn to what contaminates, what desecrates, what profanes. She revels in what is physically unclean: milk, urine, blood, eggs, raw animal testicles, an eyeball. She has sex in proximity to death—twice. These acts aren’t just shocking; they carry real physical risk: thrush, infection, disease. Her pleasure is not just transgressive. It is anti-sanctity. Simone isn’t merely an inverted ideal—she is the anti-woman.</p>
<p>Catholic womanhood follows a sacred progression: maidenhood, wifehood, motherhood. A woman’s holiness is measured through purity, obedience, and reproduction. Simone refuses all three. She is sexually active before marriage, expresses no romantic affection for The Narrator, and refuses every suggestion of fertility.</p>
<p>But it is Simone’s commitment to the destruction of her potential motherhood which fascinates me most.</p>
<p>Bodily fluids are a prominent motif in <em>Story of the Eye</em>. The characters urinate, ejaculate, and bleed for sexual pleasure. They don’t just excrete, but play with these fluids. They are a source of pleasure for Simone and The Narrator. But despite this focus on fluids, there is an absence of any associated with motherhood: no breast milk, no amniotic fluid, no menstrual blood. Characters bleed, but never in the service of motherhood or fertility.</p>
<p>But what about semen? The first time Simone and The Narrator have penetrative sex is next to Marcelle’s corpse. By the book’s definition, this is when Simone loses her virginity–a true rejection of Catholic womanhood. But following this act of symbolism, The Narrator returns to his habit of ejaculating onto Simone’s body rather than into it. Semen is written not as a fluid of creation, but one of defilement.</p>
<p>Bataille is famous for his equivalences–the egg, the eye, the testicles, the sun. The egg is, by far, his most common motif. Eggs are a universal symbol of fertility, birth, and life. But in <em>Story of the Eye</em>, eggs are treated as an object of Simone’s pleasure. As anyone who has had the misfortune of discovering r/oviposition will know, this is a surprisingly common kink. However, where oviposition is often about the association of the egg with birth, Simone inserts eggs into her anus rather than her vagina. The placement of the egg in this context reverses its sacredness–not a site of creation, but of waste. When Simone escalates by crushing the eggs inside her anus, it is a symbolic abortion—not of a child, but of the very idea of motherhood. It is a declaration that her body will not be a vessel of life. In destroying the egg and birthing its pieces, Simone claims power. The sacred role of mother is replaced by the sovereign role of self. This is not eroticism–it’s iconoclasm.</p>

  Sin Behind the Door: Marcelle and Masturbation
  <a class="anchor" href="#sin-behind-the-door-marcelle-and-masturbation">#</a>
</h3>
<p>While Simone is the anti-woman, Marcelle is our reference for Catholic womanhood. She begins as a pure, god-fearing girl and becomes the fixation of The Narrator and especially Simone. Her corruption arouses them and eventually becomes essential to it.</p>
<p>Marcelle is first introduced to the reader at the end of the first chapter when she stumbles across Simone and The Narrator having sex. Simone promptly exposes Marcelle to The Narrator and they sexually assault her while telling her not to cry. She eventually joins in, tears still rolling down her cheeks.</p>
<p>A week later, Simone manipulates Marcelle into trusting her again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please forgive me, Marcelle,” she murmured. “What happened the other day was absurd, but that doesn’t mean we can’t be friends now. I promise we’ll never lay a hand on you again.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Marcelle is described by The Narrator as having “an unusual lack of willpower”. This makes it clear that he is aware that they are manipulating her. When the situation they coax her into–an orgy at Marcelle’s home–begins to get uncomfortable for her, she asks to leave. They once again manipulate her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We promised we wouldn’t touch you, Marcelle. Why would you want to leave?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being convinced to stay, Marcelle is still uncomfortable with the situation. When she begins to feel aroused, she pleads The Narrator to leave her to masturbate in peace in a wardrobe. It is left unclear whether it is The Narrator who locks Marcelle in the wardrobe or if the door simply locks behind her, but the event still traumatises her. When the door is finally unlocked, she exits with a broken mind. She is shortly institutionalised.</p>
<p>I interpret Marcelle’s experience as religious. She chooses the wardrobe—a facsimile of the confessional—as her sanctuary. She masturbates not with pleasure, but with confession, because to her, she has sinned. But where a priest might have absolved her, there is only silence—no lattice in the wooden panel. She loses control of her bladder, literally leaking contrition. She is wracked with sobs, undone by the horror of the aftermath, knowing she is unforgiven. Her consequent descent into madness is not a reaction to sexuality itself, but to the failure of the religious structure that should have held her. When the door is finally unlocked, she emerges as a mirror of the wardrobe itself—a facsimile of Marcelle. She is forever trapped in that moment.</p>
<p>Later, after The Narrator and Simone break Marcelle out of the institution, they return to the bedroom. Her madness is revealed to be trauma when she recognises the  narrator as the figure she called “The Cardinal.”. At the time she first left the wardrobe, The Narrator had been stained by blood and wearing a red cap. In her dissociated state, Marcelle conflates him with a cardinal, further supporting the Catholic reading of the scene. This realisation of The Narrator as her abuser drives her back to the wardrobe, to the place that contains herself. In that recognition, she returns to the only space that still holds meaning: the wardrobe—the site of her ruin, her sanctuary, her failed confession. It is there that she hangs herself. The ritual is complete. Suicide becomes her final sacrament.</p>

  White Flags and Dirty Linen: Martyrdom in Absence
  <a class="anchor" href="#white-flags-and-dirty-linen-martyrdom-in-absence">#</a>
</h3>
<p>What defines Marcelle’s martyrdom is not presence, but profound absence—of agency, of confession, of salvation. She does not choose her role, nor is she given the opportunity to absolve herself. Her sanctity is forced upon her by omission, not commission.</p>
<p>The image that struck me most was of Marcelle’s soiled sheets tied to her barred window, drying in the wind—an unspoken surrender, a white flag in dirty linen. She is not an agent but a vessel. Experience happens to her. Where Simone commands her body with sovereignty, Marcelle&rsquo;s body is a contested ground. She is caught between two forces: the punitive purity of Catholic womanhood and the imposed transgression of Simone’s liberation.</p>
<p>Marcelle mirrors and reverses Lucifer: not cast down for pride, but condemned for shame. Lucifer falls for defiance—his sin is ambition, his punishment grandeur. Marcelle, by contrast, falls for yielding. Her descent is not rebellious but reluctant, not proud but penitent. Where Lucifer challenges divinity, Marcelle is crushed by its silence. Her fall is not rebellion, but collapse. Transgressive femininity, when imposed rather than claimed, suffocates just as cruelly as Catholic repression. She cannot choose sanctity or defiance—she is punished either way.</p>
<p>When she hangs herself in Simone’s wardrobe, it is not a chosen martyrdom. She dies not for a cause, but because no salvation was offered. She never had the chance to confess. That absence becomes her holiness. Her body, in death, becomes a catalyst. Her corpse unlocks something in both Simone and The Narrator that cannot be undone. She becomes a dark sacrament, the trigger of descent. Her martyrdom is not a sacrament but a liturgical rupture—she tempts them further into Hell, not by will, but by consequence.</p>
<p>Marcelle surrenders not to God, not to salvation, but to herself. That surrender, silent and stained, is what renders her sacred.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="staining-the-sacred-fluid-as-assertion">
  Staining the Sacred: Fluid as Assertion
  <a class="anchor" href="#staining-the-sacred-fluid-as-assertion">#</a>
</h3>
<p>In Story of the Eye, fluids permeate everything. The very text is soiled with milk, urine, blood, and semen. It seems to be something Bataille had a real interest in. As someone who cannot bear most bodily fluids, you can imagine how I suffered to bring you this essay.</p>
<p>The relationship each character has with fluids is essential to understanding the novella. Fluids represent autonomy.</p>
<p>Simone chooses her fluids—again and again. She expels waste with purpose, like a dog marking territory. The Narrator gifts his fluids to Simone and takes them from others. Theirs is a shared sovereignty, exercised through saturation.</p>
<p>Marcelle, by contrast, leaks. She wets herself, she cries, her body is aroused without her consent. Her fluids are not declarations—they are symptoms. Confessional, not pleasurable. Where Simone wields waste as power, Marcelle becomes a vessel of ruin. She is undone by her fluids.</p>
<p>We see the same with other characters. The orgy participants have their fluids wrung from them; the Narrator emerges covered in blood not his own. The priest in the finale is forced to orgasm and it spells his death.</p>
<p>To choose to expel fluids is to assert power. To extract fluids from others is to dominate. And to leak involuntarily is to be read as sacred—but never safe.</p>
<p>Waste is holy when chosen. Tragic when imposed. Always sacred.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="this-is-my-body-desecrated-for-you">
  This Is My Body, Desecrated for You
  <a class="anchor" href="#this-is-my-body-desecrated-for-you">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Fluids are sacred in <em>Story of the Eye</em> because the characters choose to waste them. It’s deliberate. Ritualistic. A rejection of Catholicism’s artificial model of scarcity—where grace is rationed, sin hoarded, purity policed. But what of bodies themselves? What of the waste of flesh, not just fluid?</p>
<p>Bataille’s father had syphilis. As the disease consumed him, Bataille watched his mind unravel and his flesh rot. The holy mystery of the Eucharist—where blood purifies and flesh sustains—becomes, in this context, inverted. Syphilis is the anti-communion: blood that corrupts, flesh that ulcerates. Not transubstantiation, but putrefaction.</p>
<p>Syphilis reminds me of the Eucharist inverted. During communion, the wine becomes the blood of Christ and the wafer his flesh. The blood purifies and the flesh sustains. But syphilis turns this on its head. Blood corrupts and infects, ulcers consume. Communion gives life and syphilis brings rot.</p>
<p>The burden of this father—his decay, his need—left an imprint. Not a trauma, necessarily, but a proximity to bodily degradation that made the sacred seem not above the flesh, but tangled in its rot. Bataille once intended to become a priest. He never abandoned the sacred; he just learned to find it elsewhere. In waste. In defilement. In the obscene liturgy of dying flesh.</p>
<p>Bataille constructed his entire belief system to the inversion of desecration and consecration. That which spoils is more sacred than that which doesn’t, for how else are we to tell it is alive? Would you not say that something approaching death is closer to God than something just born? It is this question that Bataille seems to ask the reader.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="spilled-spat-spent-waste-as-worship">
  Spilled, Spat, Spent: Waste as Worship
  <a class="anchor" href="#spilled-spat-spent-waste-as-worship">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Story of the Eye* is written in Catholic. Not for Catholics, not by one in good standing—but by someone who speaks the grammar of sacraments, guilt, and grace. The novella reads like a perverted mass. Each act echoes a ritual: baptism, communion, confession, crucifixion. Blasphemy is only coherent in the language of belief.</p>
<p>Did Bataille ever truly lose his faith in God? I doubt it. He lost his faith in the Ecclesia, certainly. But belief? One does not write so feverishly against God unless God remains a concern. His writing isn’t atheistic—it’s adversarial. Heretical. Heresy presumes something sacred worth desecrating.</p>
<p>Bataille’s characters worship—but not as Christians. The Narrator worships Simone like a deity, an object of infinite mystery and unreachable grace. She accepts that worship without reciprocation—much like God. To worship is to expect nothing in return. It is not a transaction, but a sacrifice.</p>
<p>Marcelle, too, becomes divine. But hers is a different theology: she is not prayed to, but consumed. Devoured in body, then memory. Her death is transubstantiation inverted. She is no longer pure, but sacred through violation. They celebrate with her corpse. It is grotesque, but it is recognisably ritual. This is not Christianity, but another faith. The god is released from its mortal prison and returned to its essence through consumption.</p>
<p>Marcelle’s final sacrament is not hers alone. It sanctifies the others. It seals their worship. In Bataille’s world, holiness leaks.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Bataille very probably wrote Story of the Eye as personal pornography. But whether or not he intended it as philosophical, the work functions as one. Its transgressions demand interpretation. Through the lens of sacred defilement, performed womanhood, and bodily fluid as power, we can read this novella not merely as obscenity—but as theology in drag.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, I am in no way qualified to write this essay. This is my first foray into analysis rather than just review since I was in my mid-teens—and let’s be honest, I didn’t take it seriously back then. I wrote this first without having read any formal critique, <em>ever</em>. But I do feel like I have learnt something from this. I feel like I am in a better position to rewrite this essay in the future with citations and evidence. And I have also discovered a burning desire to analyse more. To fall into the pit of comparative literature.</p>
