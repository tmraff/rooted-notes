# Exhibition No. 1 – Simmer 2025  

*A seasonal exhibition curated by Tristan Rafferty*

The sun circles the sky instead of setting. The trowies are trapped in their knowes.

## Vibes

- Warmth but not heat
- Singing to the birds
- Sun-bleached hair
- Sea swimming
- Productive laziness

## Currently Rooting

My current obsession is with transgression. What separates it from taboo? What makes it worthy of study rather than disgust?

I’m also trying to find meaning again after having organ damage. Feeling normal things is hard after experiencing that kind of pain—nothing compares in intensity. I want to experience new things, meet new people, learn new skills, try new (alcohol-free, sadly) drinks.

## Personal Changelog

- Postponed CCNA exam date for health reasons
- Postponed university for health reasons
- Started online BSL lessons
- Not contributing to Issue 3 of Everyday Dragons to ensure I don’t burnout

## Quotes and Seeds

> They didn’t understand it, but like so many unfortunate events in life, just because you don’t understand it doesn’t mean it isn’t so.
>
> Lemony Snicket, *The Bad Beginning*

> In a darkened theatre, our compulsory gaze is in reflexive sympathy with the camera’s interests and our pleasure stirred by the human forms onscreen, some of whom seem posed for our perusal.
>
> Lauren Michele Jackson, *The Invention of “The Male Gaze”*

> The problem wasn’t anything he had done. That Victor was sure of. He was being thwarted. God was just not going to give in without a fight. At least it did confirm that he, Victor Hoppe, was on the right track, because God would never have put up such a fight otherwise.
>
> Stefan Brijs, *The Angel Maker*

- The eroticism of someone slicing your palm open for a blood offering. There’s a tenderness. A trust. An intimacy. You’re letting someone else slice through your layers. You’re trusting them with your pain. The blood beads ruby along the cut.
- Valentino Braitenberg was an Italian researcher who explored the sense-act model in the 1980s. Unlike W. Grey Walter, Braintenberg never built his vehicles. He was also unaware of Grey Walter’s work.
