I keep finding myself thinking about how and why we share work. Or, more accurately, why we choose not to share the work we produce.

<!--more-->

I always feel the obligation to ensure my work is of the utmost, almost unachievable, quality before sharing it. I feel that I have a responsibility to only share that which is well-researched and as correct as possible, as well as well-produced.

Let’s be honest, though: the majority of that I create is not high-quality. The majority of what I create is actually pretty shite. This means I am sitting on roughly 430K words that no one has ever seen. This isn’t including the tens of sketchbooks, notebooks, and other notes I have hanging around.

Despite the voice in my head telling me that no one is interested, “Why would they be?”, it turns out that a surprising number of people do care. Every time I let someone flip through my sketchbook or a silly little zine I’ve made, they tell me they’d like to see more. I was even told by one person that I was “selfish” for keeping my work “hidden away.”

I still think that’s a hilarious thing to say, but it does make me think… Perhaps the work I consider imperfect and poor-in-quality is worth sharing anyway. After all, what is the harm? Someone may call me a fool, sure, but people already call me a fool for not sharing my work. And maybe, even if I share imperfect work, someone might find it joyful or a seed for their own thought or make me think by telling me how wrong I am.

All it takes is a little bravery from me.
