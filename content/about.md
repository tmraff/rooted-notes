# About Rooted Notes

Rooted Notes is a living archive of thoughts, essays, experiments, and arguments. It is a place for ideas to grow, sprawl, and occasionally bloom.

This space exists to share thought in motion. There is a cultural expectation that ideas must be final and unchanging — that to grow is to betray oneself.

I reject this philosophy. We should be given a place to learn and transform without judgement for that which we no longer believe. We deserve an archive of curiosity and inquiry rather than certainty. Rooted Notes is my quiet resistance: a space where thought is allowed to move, to doubt, and to flower.

Explore this digital garden. I welcome you to agree, argue, and wonder.

# About me

I am an artist, writer, and perennial learner. I currently work as a part-time zine library assistant and am pursuing a degree in cybersecurity. I am regularly referred to as a “contradiction”, “creature”, “pretty boy”, “queer disaster”, and “Tristan”.
