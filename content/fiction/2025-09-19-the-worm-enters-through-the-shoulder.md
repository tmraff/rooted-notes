## Story

It started as an itch behind my shoulder. A sort of wriggling, like my very muscles were restless.

I scratched until I bled.
It didn’t help.

I went to the pharmacist but they told me there was nothing — just a small scratch. They sold me some Germaline.

It moved beneath the skin like a second pulse.
Not fast. Never painful.
Just… curious.

He threaded himself through the nerves slowly,
with the patience of a saint or a predator.

I began sleeping shirtless.
The fabric made him uneasy.

I tried not to like the feeling.
I failed.

He began to hum. Not aloud —
in bone.

Sometimes I twitch at night and wake up soaked.
Not with sweat.
Something more viscous.

I haven’t come in weeks,
but I feel used.

There’s no penetration.
He’s already inside.

And the worst part is —
I think he’s listening
for when I whisper please.

### Inspiration / Context

I've always been afraid of parasites in the same way that I am of sexual violation. They're both very abject concepts–two beings blurred into one, thresholds crossed and boundaries trampled. Both themes, especially blended, are already present in media. Take the Face Huggers from Alien and the Goa'uld from Stargate, for example. Clearly I'm not the only one with this conjoined fear.

I tried to write this in the style of Julia Armfield, who's short stories have greatly inspire me.
